# tweetlingo
Using NodeJS combined with Socket.io, Twitter API, and Python, I created a website that makes a wordcloud from a Twitter handle

- Express and a simple static site handles the front end 
- Websocket communcation using Socket.io to the server 
- A python script is used to make the Twitter API call. Mongodb is used to store Twitter responses to reduce the number of API calls.
